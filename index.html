                <p class="p1" id="text1"><span align="left" style="font-weight: bolder;">Naruto Uzumaki</span>, as implied by his name, is the main protagonist of the Naruto anime and manga series. At the onset of the series, Naruto is revealed to be the container of the <span ><a href="https://naruto.neoseeker.com/wiki/Nine-Tailed_Demon_Fox" class="orange">Nine-Tailed Demon Fox</a></span> ,
                 which nearly destroyed his village twelve years prior to the onset of the current plot. Masashi Kishimoto, the creator of the Naruto series,

                 As such, Naruto's demeanor and appearance somewhat mirrors that of Goku, the main character of the <a href="https://dragonball.neoseeker.com/wiki/Main_Page" class="orange">Dragonball</a> series. 
                 Nevertheless, Naruto has become a hit character in his own right in the anime and manga industry.</p></div>

                    <p class="p1">Naruto has the physique of the average boy his age,
                         though he is taller than average japenese boy height. He has blond,
                          spiky hair and blue eyes. 
                          One peculiar characteristic of Naruto's appearance is the whiskers on his cheeks, 
                          which is a result from his mother, Kushina Uzumaki, 
                          being the host of the demon fox while she was pregnant with Naruto. 
                          Naruto wears a orange and blue jacket with a red spiral symbol on the back which is rolled up at the sleeves, 
                          along with a black shirt underneath. 
                          Additionally, he wears orange pants which are rolled up and blue open-toed shoes common among ninjas. 
                          Naruto's outfit is often a factor that ties him to Dragonball's protagonist Goku,
                         whose attire is also orange and blue in color.</p>

                        Naruto in Part I debuts as a mischievous, 
                        rambunctious adolescent shy boy who often pulled pranks and got in trouble with his superiors. 
                        Though most of his classmates and other people often undermine his capabilities, 
                        Naruto remains steadfast and determined to become a successful ninja and rise to become Hokage. 
                        His ambitious goals, however, sometimes makes him very obstinate, 
                        thus leading to conflict with his own teammates and teachers, particularly Sasuke Uchiha, 
                        his former teammate and self-proclaimed rival. 
                        Naruto has also proven himself to be somewhat of a pervert, 
                        creating the Sexy Technique in which he transforms into a naked female version of himself, 
                        and the Harem Technique in which he uses the aforementioned technique in conjunction with the Shadow Replication Technique. 
                        In Part II, Naruto does become progressively more mature, 
                        though he still exhibits some childish tendencies, such as hastily arguing with his superiors. 
                        Though Naruto isn't a prodigy or extraordinarily talented like Sasuke and Neji, 
                        he has proven himself to be exceptionally clever, which has earned him the nickname as the "most unpredictable ninja." 
                        Moreover, despite being ignored and hated for the majority of his childhood, Naruto can be very compassionate, 
                        and because of his harsh upbringing he has been able to empathize with several antagonists, 
                        such as Gaara, throughout the series. However, his strong compassion for others often backfires, 
                        as he can easily become enraged should he witness anyone he cares about be mortally wounded--a personality trait which is exacerbated by the nine-tailed fox inside him.

                    <p class="p1">Naruto is the carrier of the Nine-Tailed Demon Fox that was sealed within him by his father, 
                        the Fourth Hokage when it attacked Konohagakure twelve years prior to the onset of the main plot. 
                        Minato and Kushina Uzumaki supposedly died trying to help defend the village from the fox's onslaught shortly after he was born. 
                        However, since a law was enacted forbidding villagers from speaking of the aforementioned events, 
                        Naruto grew up not knowing a single detail about who his parents were. 
                        He was even unaware of the fox inside him up until around the time he became a ninja. 
                        An orphan living alone, Naruto would often pull pranks and vandalize monuments and statues in order to draw attention from those who shunned him. 
                        Though he trained to become a ninja at the academy, 
                        he would mostly goof off in class, inventing techniques like Sexy Technique (Sexy no jutsu) in which he transformed into a naked female version of himself.
                        Naruto's lifelong ambition is to become the greatest hokage (lit. "fire shadow"), 
                        the highest ranking ninja of Konoha, so that people will finally give him the respect he deserves. 
                        His motivation and determination to achieve his goal drives him to train extremely hard. 
                        However, this has also made him very stubborn--never taking no for an answer when requesting high ranking missions. 
                        Some of his traits, good and bad, even manage to rub off on other ninja, including antagonists such as Gaara of the Sand Village, 
                        and the grandson of the Third Hokage, Konohamaru.
                        He becomes accepted by several of his peers, ranging from his original teacher Iruka Umino and his team members Sasuke, 
                        Sakura and Kakashi, to two of the three legendary Sannin. He steadily becomes more powerful as the series progresses, 
                        and even learns advanced techniques mastered only by high-level ninja such as Jiraiya of the Sannin and the late Fourth Hokage.
                        In Part II, Naruto finally gained the recognition that he has been striving for after saving the village from Nagato in the Pain Invasion Arc. 
                        When Madara Uchiha announces the Fourth Shinobi World War against the Allied Shinobi Forces because they wouldn't hand over Killer Bee and Naruto(the remaining uncaptured Jinchurikis), 
                        Naruto is put in the center of attention of the whole Shinobi World. Naruto has finally gained the respect of the Third Raikage after surpassing his speed in Nine-Tails Chakra Mode.</p>

                        Though at first generally not talented, Jiraiya saw the potential in this child, 
                        as he stated the only reason he couldn't be very successful is because he had trouble manipulating his massive reserves of chakra, 
                        which was understandable. And, with the help of Jiraiya and the Toads in part I, 
                        his powers increased highly by mastering the Sage Mode. In fact, he has gotten so incredibly strong, 
                        he even beat Nagato/Six Paths Of Pein, the holder of the legendary Rinnegan, and the apparent leader of Akatsuki, 
                        with relative ease. Zetsu has even stated after Nagato's death by Naruto, that he's probably stronger than Sasuke currently was. 
                        As such, Naruto is currently the strongest ninja in the Leaf Village, 
                        and also has become one of the strongest ninja in the Shinobi World.</p>

                        and his skills at it continued to improve. His skills in Taijutsu, 
                        as of now, is extremely high, and rivals that of even Guy and the Raikage. 
                        He is stated to be the most unpredictable ninja by even Kakashi himself, as well, and is highly innovative and strategic in battle, 
                        to the point where he outsmarted the likes of Zabuza, as well as other S-Ranks villains, on multiple occasions. 
                        His Ninjutsu, however, is somewhat limited to the Rasengan, his signature move, and the Shadow Clone Technique,

                        During the Fourth Shinobi World War, Naruto trained with Bee and was able to contain the Nine-Tailed Fox's chakra and gain control of it's use thus unlocking the Nine-Tails Chakra Mode. 
                        After unlocking it, the Nine-Tails Chakra Mode has been Naruto's main arsenal. 
                        He utilized it to make many variations of Rasengans.
